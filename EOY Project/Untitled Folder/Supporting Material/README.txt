This is the supporting material for my dissertation - Elliot Linsey 210764484

The main material is stored within the Jupyter Notebooks:

Analysis of full dataset.ipynb

ARIMA-Copy1.ipynb

Chi2.ipynb

Percentage Changes.ipynb

The outputs should be saved in the notebooks, however they will not run without the datasets that are 
in the google drive link below. In case the outputs are not working properly, I have also attached
pdf copies. If you do try and run the notebooks with the cleaned data, you will need to re-path to the
data location.  

The rest of the notebooks are to do with the data cleaning and concatenation and are not needed to be run
as the fully cleaned datasets are available at:

They were too big to attach to QMPlus and zipped are around 1gb to download

The two AgenaRisk networks are: 

outcomesCutDown.cmpx - this is the smaller one

True Crime NumbersTriangle2.cmpx - this is the larger one

Thanks for reading!
