    "In this lab, you will complete the full process of describing and then implementing an algorithm. You will do so on a topic relevant to data science: _(simple) linear regression_. Please note that this lab is assessed, i.e., you will need to submit the results of your work on QM+. To submit your work, first download/export your Jupyter notebook as PDF. Then upload the PDF file in the submission area on QM+."

    "## Preparation: Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "If necessary (depending on your background), read up on (simple) linear regression. Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression) provides a good starting point, but you might as well choose other sources. (You do not need to include any information about this in your submission.)\n",

    "## Task 1: Describe Linear Regression in English\n",
    "Given a dataset of $n$ values $(x_i, y_i)$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, describe the process to compute values $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that $$\\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \\alpha x_i - \\beta)^2$$ is minimal. This will yield a (linear) model $y = \\alpha x + \\beta$ adhering to the least-squares condition.\n",

    "Come up with a dataset of just 3 values ($\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\\}$). Then exercise the algorithm of Task 1 on this small dataset. You might prefer to do this using pen and paper. For your submission, provide at least the dataset that you have chosen and the resulting values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n",

    "Starting from your description of the steps to undertake, transfer English and Maths to Python. Note that you are expected to fully implement the mathematical operations instead of using a library function such as `scikit` or `statsmodels`.\n",

    "Use at least the dataset of Task 2, or possibly also other datasets, to exercise your implementation of Task 3.\n",
