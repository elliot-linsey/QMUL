    "Simple processing of input files using `readlines()` and `split()` works well for small-scale input files. Larger volumes of data necessitate more efficient processing. As an example, consider the trip record data provided for New York City (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). You might try and process such data in a simplistic manner, but you will likely want to use optimised modules such as `csv`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html. You might use this data in a number of ways. One way in which it has been used in the past is https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X13000740#s0050 (use your QMUL credentials for \"Instituational Access\")."
