    "\n",
    "The overall aim of this notebook is to gain familiarity with correlations (in the broad sense of the influence of one variable on another) for both continuous and categorical variables. We first explore correlation, then cross tabulation and finally the distribution of continuous variables conditioned by a categorical one. \n",

    "This notebook looks at some data from the US National Bridge Inspection maintained by the Federal Highways Agency (FHWA), part of the US Department of Transportation. The original data comes from the [National Bridge Inspection](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm) section of the FHWA's web site. However, it has been greatly simplified. If you are interested in a particular bridge, you can use the structure number to look it up (including on google maps, where the satellite imaging shows a picture) on the (Info Bridge System)[https://infobridge.fhwa.dot.gov/].\n",
    "\n",
    "**The aim of the Bridge Inspection programme is to check on the state of bridges so that necessary repairs can be carried out. If this is not done, a bridge can fail. The dataset has information about the bridges and the condition given in the most recent inspection.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The FHWA's database covers the whole USA. Our data is only for the state of Texas. \n",
    "* As well as bridges, the FHWA's database covers tunnels (there seem to be no highway tunnels in Texas) and 'culverts'. A culvert is a form of drain, allowing water to pass under a highway. The culverts have been removed, leaving only the bridges.\n",
    "* All of the bridges carry a highway (that is, a road runs over the bridge). What is underneath varies: another road, a waterway or a railway are among the possibilities. \n",

    "We can load the data from the CSV file. A 'type map' is used to set the types of each variables. Without this, Pandas guesses at the types, representing non-numeric fields as string. Instead, we represent them as Categorical Variables: using type `category` gives the default behaviour (use each unique value as a category and categories are not ordered). However, for the ordinal variables (categorical variables with an order) we must declare a suitable type explicitly.   "

    "1. It is strange that the most popular number of lanes under a bridge is zero. The are several explanations for this and the full picture is not available from the data included here. There is a variable `service_under` that shows that some bridges run over buildings - look at this. Another explanation is that the road of interest runs under the bridge so that the 'under' number refers to what is on the bridge. This needs more examination as this data has been excluded!\n",
    "2. Sometimes a number is used when the true value is unknown. Can you see a probable example of this in any of these variables. We need to ask a highways engineer from Texas (or consult a data dictionary) to be sure. \n",
