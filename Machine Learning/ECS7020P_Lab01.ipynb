    "\n",
    "**Machine learning** provides computational tools to extract knowledge from data. Therefore, to build and deploy machine learning solutions we need to use a  **data science computing environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python**-based computing environments are one of the most popular options among data scientists. Python provides standard, **in-built** functionalities that can be extended **importing** third-party packages. Some of the most common third-party libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ECS7020P labs use **Python-powered Jupyter notebooks** to create **interactive** data science computing environments. A Jupyter notebook consists of **code cells** that contain code that can be executed, and **text cells** that are used for documetation purposes. Jupyter notebooks are powered by an **engine**, in our case Python, that can be on your machine (**local runtime**) or hosted on a remote, cloud-based machine (**hosted runtime**). The instructions in each lab will assume that you are using **Google Colab**, but you should be able to use other runtimes too. If you choose other runtimes you might need to do some minor tweaks, such as installing a library that is provided by the Google Colab environment by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to familiarise ourselves with our Python environment. Once you've completed this lab, you will be able to attempt a quiz on QM+ that is worth **2 marks**."
