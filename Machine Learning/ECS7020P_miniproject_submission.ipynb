    "\n",
    "The mini-project consists of two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Basic solution** [6 marks]: Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a Potter or a StarWars audio segment and predicts its song label (either Harry or StarWars).\n",
    "2.   **Advanced solution** [10 marks]: There are two options. (i) Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model. (ii) Create a product that uses the functionality provided by a model trained on the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset (e.g. a simple App that predicts the label Harry or StarWars when you hum to it).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The submission will consist of two Jupyter notebooks, one for the basic solution and another one for advanced solution. Please **name each notebook**:\n",

    "* ECS7020P_miniproject_basic.ipynb\n",

    "*   **Code cells**, implementing each step.\n",
    "*   **Output cells**, i.e. the output from each code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "and **should have the structure** indicated below. Notebooks will not be run, please make sure that the output cells are saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "How will we evaluate your submission?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Conciseness in your writing (10%).\n",
    "*   Correctness in your methodology (30%).\n",
