    "# Lab Work: Static Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this lab is to introduce you to a concept of program analysis that is not as widely known as testing: **static analysis**. In static analysis, programs are scrutinised (for errors or other properties) without actually executing the program. Testing, where programs are executed, is then often referred to as _dynamic_ analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab really serves as a teaser and not any kind of comprehensive introduction. You will find pointers to (optional) further reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of several kinds of static analyses lie _control-flow graphs_ (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/control-flow-graph). We have previously looked into control flow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow, as previously done in lecture 2). Control-flow graphs (CFGs) formalise this concept.\n",

    "When we do have a control-flow graph, however, we can answer questions about _reachability_: is a particular instruction reachable? The control-flow graph provides an over-approximation in that reachability in the graph does not guarantee that there is an actual execution where the statement is reachable.
