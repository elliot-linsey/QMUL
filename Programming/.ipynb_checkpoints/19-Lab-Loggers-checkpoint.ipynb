    "# Lab Work: Loggers\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this lab is to introduce you to Python's `logging` module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html and https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html), which implements the concept of _loggers_. A logger provides for configureable output, enabling more finegrained control than plain `print` statements. Once again, consider `binary_search`. In previous work we have inserted various `print` statements to aid debugging or coverage analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code uses two loggers: the global logger as well as a custom logger for coverage information. The configurability of loggers makes it much easier to enable/disable debug output, unlike previous attempts where disabling debug output meant removing or commenting out various `print` statements."
