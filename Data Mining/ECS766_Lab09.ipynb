    "Smoothing is a technique applied to a timeseries to remove the fine-grained variation between time steps. The aim of smoothing is to remove noise and better expose the the underlying processes that generated the timeseries. Moving averages are a simple and common type of smoothing used in timeseries analysis and timeseries forecasting.\n",

    "Calculating a moving average involves creating a new series where the values comprise the average of raw observations in the original timeseries. A moving average requires that you specify a **window size**. This defines the number of raw observations used to calculate the moving average value. The “moving” part in the moving average refers to the fact that the window defined by its window width is slid along the timeseries to calculate the average values in the new series.\n",

    "The above figure is symmetric, and the upper half of the above figure can be discarded for analysing the timeseries, but it is useful if we would like to reconstruct the original timeseries. By inspecting the lower half of the DFT, we can see one clear peak. This peak indicates the predominant (i.e. most important) frequency of the timeseries. This frequency indicates the predominant period of the timeseries, in other words the length of the unit in samples which is repeated throughout the timeseries. We observe one such predominant frequency and corresponding period, since the timeseries consists of a (periodic) cosine function.\n",
